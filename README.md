## About

SLY-ASDF is a contrib for [SLY](https://github.com/joaotavora/sly) that adds support for editing ASDF systems, exposing several utilities for working with and loading systems. When using the built-in system load utlity, accessed via `, + load-system` from the repl, ASDF system compilation and load errors will be trapped and recorded as with other sly compilation errors, as opposed to dumping into the debugger like with calling `asdf:load-system` directly.

Ported from [slime](https://github.com/slime/slime/blob/master/contrib/slime-asdf.el) with changes to support [`package-inferred-system`](https://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/asdf/The-package_002dinferred_002dsystem-extension.html). Potentially I'd like to make some future changes to improve debugging ASDF systems (e.g., cut off stack trace at system boundaries, etc.)

## Installation 
Now available from MELPA

Installing manually will require the contrib be registered in SLY's `sly-contrib` variable. 
```
(add-to-list 'sly-contribs 'sly-asdf 'append)
```
## Experimental
SLY-ASDF currently supports a very experimental system-aware checker that builds on flymake. This loads the system in a separate process and highlights any compilation/load errors for currently opened buffers. Only tested with SBCL. Enable this with 
```
(setq sly-asdf-enable-experimental-syntax-checking t)
(require 'sly-asdf-flymake)
```
